# artcritical
**A modern art listing tool for the art magazine artcritical.com**

## Functionalities
The List lets visitors explore a list of all art shows in NYC and Philadelphia. It has not been updated since the COVID-19 pandemic but was before that the most thorough list available thanks to a dedicated team of editors. A calendar lists all art openings and events for the week and an interactive map displays all galleries and their currents shows. 

Users can create an account and craft their own custom lists to share, email and checkout as they visit galleries. 
Admins can use their account the same way, as well as editing shows, galleries and manage the ad system.

## Tools used
- Nodejs, React, React Router, Flux, Express
- Webpack, Babel
- Passport, Cloudinary, Draft, MapBox
